Hi! My name is Noah Tanner and I am a third year mechanical engineering student at Cal Poly SLO. 
I have created this github account so that I can share what I make as I continue learning to code
I currently am just learning python and I will expand to C# and html next.
In my time that I am not studying or in class, I enjoy mixing music, skatebaording, video games, and dirtbiking

If you want to collaborate or have any input for my projects, please feel free to reach out or email me (noahetanner@gmail.com)

It was nice to meet you!
